# Controls

Use arrow keys to accurately align the MabiCookerV3 window over the Cooking window pixel by pixel.

If you're on 1080p Borderless, the window should automatically be placed on top of the default position of the Cooking window.

# TODO

- [ ] Add 1440p (2k) Default window position.
- [ ] Add 2160p (4k) Default window position.
- [ ] MVVM
- [ ] Move Window pixel by pixel with arrow keys (Still incomplete)
- [ x ] Added Enter hotkey
